This structure improves readability, ensures each task is clearly communicated, and eliminates redundancy.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
You will be given various tasks and each of the task will have some categories such as pentest, sme, other etc. I want you to go through all tasks i send you and then create one final task update, this will combines all the categories updates. for example all pentest category point of different people should under a single pentest category. combine some points if they feel repetetive. Do not output anything other than the updates.
